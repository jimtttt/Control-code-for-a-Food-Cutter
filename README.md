# Control-code-for-a-Food-Cutter
Backup of a school project, for which our group designed and built a food cutter.

The machine has 4 knives of different shape, motor B is for making one of them in place for cutting. Motor C pushed foods onto the knife and motor A makes the knife rotate to do the cutting.
